    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a community project, it is important that Gladius is lightweight and modular enough to support a wide range of applications, and easy for community members to extend it to meet their specific needs.
Over the past month we've spent a bunch of time refactoring Gladius to make the engine more modular, and to support plugins through an extension framework.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Starting with 0.2, we will be shipping Gladius as the engine core plus a few default extensions.
This allows us to keep Gladius lightweight by removing large third-party libraries from the core, and allows developers to bring their own preferred libraries for things like rendering backends.
As a result, some engine parts that used to live in <a href="https://github.com/gladiusjs/gladius-core">gladiusjs/gladius-core</a> are now extensions living in their own repositories: David Perit and I have already created <a href="https://github.com/gladiusjs/gladius-cubicvr">gladiusjs/gladius-cubicvr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gladiusjs/gladius-box2d">gladiusjs/gladius-box2d</a> extensions, and they are good examples of how to write an extension for Gladius.</p>

<p>We have created a new repository, <a href="https://github.com/gladiusjs/gladius">gladiusjs/gladius</a>, to host the shipped version of Gladius.  It will consist of the engine core along with a default set of extensions sufficient for building a game, a directory of examples, and documentation.
You can also use this repository to report defects and add feature requests.
It's worth noting that as a result, <a href="https://github.com/gladiusjs/gladius-core">gladiusjs/gladius-core</a> no longer contains the complete source for the engine.</p>

<p>If you're interested in Gladius and would like to contribute, please have a look at our repositories <a href="https://github.com/gladiusjs">here</a>, introduce yourself on our mailing list <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/community-games">here</a>, or come chat with us in #games on irc.mozilla.org. We'd also love to work with anyone who's interested in creating great documentation or examples.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week we released an early prototype of our 3D game engine. The engine is pure HTML5/JS and is designed to run client-side in the browser. Right now we're focusing our test efforts in Firefox and Chrome, but the engine should run well in other standards-compliant browsers that support WebGL.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So, what can the prototype do? Right now the engine provides</p>

<ul>
<li>a game loop</li>
<li>resource loading</li>
<li>an entity/component framework</li>
<li>a 3D renderer (CubicVR)</li>
<li>a 2D physics engine (Box2D)</li>
<li>a bunch of unit tests and examples</li>
</ul>


<p>Modularity is a strong design goal and we use require.js to keep the source code in small files that define reusable modules.</p>

<h3>demo</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/no-comply.png" width="370" height="280" title="no comply demo" alt="[ image: no comply demo ]"></p>

<p>Earlier this year we started collaborating with Andor Salga to build a demo game on our prototype engine. The demo shows off some of what the engine can do right now, but it's also been very helpful in testing out some of our APIs. It's also helping us collect some early performance feedback from the platform and identify <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=744546">issues</a>.</p>

<h3>what's next</h3>

<p>You probably noticed that there are some important features still missing from the engine, like sound support. In the coming weeks I'll be working on a cross-platform sound extension for the engine. Input also needs work. Right now there's keyboard support but it's difficult to use. I plan to add support for input maps and stateful event handling to make it easier for game logic to react to state changes. Finally, I'm working on some refactoring in the engine core to clarify some key abstractions and to break code apart so that it's more reusable and easier to unit test.</p>

<p>There are a few infrastructure changes coming as well. Dan Mosedale prepared a pre-commit hook that runs our unit tests. We're also updating a bunch of programs in our toolchain to newer versions. And if we have time this quarter, we'll be refactoring our unit test suite to use require.js so that we can test our source modules in isolation.</p>

    <updated>2011-12-14T19:16:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.ottodestrukt.org/blog/2011/12/14/data-driven-game-update-loop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been refactoring the scheduler again to make it more data-driven. The previous incarnation provided priority-based scheduling, but that leaves it to the game developer to make sure that task priorities are correct, even for tasks that she didn't write herself. The first change I made was to add scheduler phases. Right now there are three, named <em>Input</em>, <em>Update</em> and <em>Render</em>. The input and render phases shouldn't result in any changes to game simulation state.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="center" src="/images/gladius-update-loop.svg" width="300" height="400" title="engine update loop" alt="[ image: engine update loop ]"></p>

<p>The second change I made was to add task groups to help capture different stages in each phase. For example, there are default groups for <em>Physics</em>, <em>Animation</em> and <em>Logic</em>, as well as others. A new task can specify a list of groups as dependencies during creation, and the scheduler will make sure that the new task runs only after each of its dependencies has finished. Creating a new task looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var t = new engine.scheduler.Task({
    schedule: {
        phase: 'Update',
        depends: ['Physics'],
        interval: 100
    },
    group: 'Animation',
    callback: function() {
        ...
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This creates an Animation task that is scheduled after all Physics tasks, and runs every 100 ms in the Update phase. Because this task is in the Animation group, any other tasks that depend on Animation will be scheduled to run after this task. This is much cooler than a hard-coded game update loop because it's not necessary to modify engine code to add new services to your game, only the schedule you pass in when you create your task.</p>
